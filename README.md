## Why Vue Js
Vue.js is an open source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web interfaces. Vue.js focusses on the view layer, offers a lot of functionality for the view layer and can be used for build powerful single-page web apps. Vue.js uses JavaScript ES5 or ES6 while Laravel provides core library for Vue.js.Itâ€™s well-structured and covers all the possible topics, precisely describing everything from installation to more in-depth things like reactivity and scaling of the app. More importantly, there is also a section comparing Vue with other JS frameworks, and naming things that those have in common (e.g. virtual DOM in Vue and React, template syntax in Vue and Angular).
